Goals Practice the use of objects and Arrays or Array List and design simple algorithms through program
ming a game of blackjack
Requirements Write a Java program that implements a game of blackjack as follows :
·The program deals two cards randomly from a deck of cards to both the player and itself.
·The player then chooses to hit or stand until he/she is either bust(over 21)or decides to stand.
·The dealer(program)hits and stands according to the following rules:
If the dealer's hand is less than 17, it hits
If the dealer's hand is 17 or more it stands
Of course, if the dealer's hand is greater than 21, it loses
· If the player and dealer tie, then the dealer wins.
·All face cards(Jack,Queen,King)are worth 10 points.
· The Ace has two possible values on which every one is more ond to the
player or dealer.
·For simplicity,we will not implement the blackjack rule
· At the end of the hand, the deck should be reset and the game starts again, until the user signals the
game to end (by hitting escape, for instance)
Starter code is provided, which has a main method that handles user interactions. You need to fill in the
·public static void buildDeck(ArrayList<Card>Deck)
This should build a standard deck of 52 playing cards assigned to the ArrayList Deck
public static void initial deck, ArrayList<Card)
This should deal two cards from the given deck into each of the given hands
·public static void dealOne(ArrayList<Card>deck,ArrayList<Card>hand)
This should deal a single card from the deck to the hand
· public static boolean check Bust(Array List<Card> hand)
This should return true if the sum of the values of the cards in the hand is greater than 21, and false
otherwise
· public static boolean dealerTurn(Array List<Card> deck, ArrayList<Card> hand)
Ins method should handle the dealer's turn, making the appropr

·public static int whoWins(ArrayList<Card>playerHand,ArrayList<Card>dealerHand)
Given two hands, this method should compare the sums of their card values and decide which hand is
greater. Return 1 if the playerHand is greater and 2 if the dealerHand is greater.
· public static String displayCard(ArrayList<Card> hand)
This should return a string describing the card with index 1 (the second card).
· public static String display Hand(ArrayList<Card> hand)
Similar to display Card, but this will return a string which describes all of the cards in the given hand,
separated by a space.
