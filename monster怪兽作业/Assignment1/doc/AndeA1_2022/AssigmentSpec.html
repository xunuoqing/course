<div class="block">Welcome to Assignment 1 for Programming Fundamentals<br>
 <br>
 In this assignment, you are approached by a game company which wants to create a card game.
 They have provided you with the basic structure of each player having a deck and hand full of cards. 
 However, they are unsure how to implement such features, so you have been selected to help them!
 
 In this assignment you are to create five classes (Card, Deck Hand, Dragon and Game).  
 The Card class will list the details of the card itself, while the Deck will store cards 
 The Hand class will contain the users health, energy and damage values, alongside the ability to draw cards from the deck
 and play the cards from their hand to increase their health or damage.
 The Dragon class will be a basic enemy with a health and damage value the player must defeat.
 The Game class is where a simple game will take place where the players Hand and a Dragon will battle each other until one wins.
 <br>
 <strong>Description</strong>
 
 In this game we want to concentrate on the management of cards
 You will create a Card class to represent one card that contains the name, attack power, health and cost of each card.
 The class will also have a number of methods related to a single card (See API documentation).
 You will also have a Deck which contains an array of 50 Cards and a Hand which contains 6 Cards.
 The Dragon is a static enemy which can have a default or custom health and damage values
 The Game itself will check for if either the player or the dragon and run out of health.
 The game will also progress through turns where the player will play a card and the dragon will attack.
 This continues until a win condition is met.
 Your job is to create the Card, Deck, Hand, Dragon and Game classes. <br>
 <br>
 <strong>Data Structure</strong><p>
 To make your life easier you will be provided with an API specification 
 (just like the JavaDocs you use for your programming). This file is stored in the doc folder.
 You must only use an array to store your cards in the Deck and Hand classes.
 You are not permitted to use any collection Classes (or Array class methods) in this assignment.
 You will need to implement each class based on the API specification for them.
 This class is just to specify the functionality required.
 Each method will contain a list of the permissible method calls.
 I have also left an indication of the length of a solution. Your solution can be shorter or longer,
 its just an indication so that you get an idea of how long a solution might be.<br>
 <p><br>
 <strong>Testing</strong><p>
 A test program is also provided for you to use.  Please read it carefully as you will be expected
 to generate your own in assignment 2.  Use the test driver as a starting point to test your Class
 as thoroughly as possible.  Note that the marker reserves the right to test more conditions 
 if they think of them.<br>
 <p><br>
 <strong>How to Do The Assignment</strong><p><br>
 I suggest you do your assignment in the following order<br>
 <ul>
 <li>Clean your project (Menu Project - Clean)
 <li>Create the five classes (Hand, Card, Deck, Dragon and Game)
 <li>Fill in the methods using the API with blank bodies (return null if necessary)
 <li>Compile and make sure that the TEST program runs (it won't work because the methods are empty, 
 but make sure it compiles with no errors). 
 <li>Write the constructors.  Test.
 <li>Write the appropriate setters and getters for each class.  Test.
 <li>Write the simplest least dependencies methods first then move on to each more complicated method.  Test each time.
 You will likely want to start with the Card class for this. While saving the Game class for last.
 </ul>
 <p><br>
 Note that when you add functionality you may have to add test scenarios to other test methods to 
 ensure you have covered all the possibilities. <br>
 <p><br>
 <strong>Additional Requirement.</strong><p>
 In addition to what is above there are a number of requirements for this assignment. Most of these are 
 to introduce interesting problems for you to solve and must be obeyed. <br>
 <ul>
 <li> As you are programming you will also need to comment your code thoroughly in each of your methods.   
 <li> You are only permitted to use the the specified methods in the java doc comments for each method.  
 <li> You may create additional methods (private only) but they are still constrained by the rules of the calling method
 <li> Make sure you set emailID to your current email id (not student id)
 </ul>
 <p>
 <strong>How We Will Mark Your Assignment.</strong>
 <ul>
 <li>We will run javadoc on your code to see if your code generates the API correctly.
 <li>We will read your code to look for style and commenting problems.
 <li>We will use a different variation of the test classes and see if we get the expected results
 </ul>
 <p><br>
 <strong>Marking Scheme</strong><p>
 75 Percent for it working totally correct (eg no issues with the testing system). Note that some of the tests
 will pass if you just fill in the method calls.  <strong>They will not get marks if they are side effects.</strong>  
 There is 25 Percent for commenting/style of code.  Finally there is a 5% bonus 
 for shuffling the deck<br>
 <p><br>
 Hint:  Many of the more complicated methods can use the easier methods to do part of their job.  You 
 will notice that some methods are only one or two lines long thats because I have taken advantage of
 other methods to do the job. It is highly encouraged for you to do this where possible to improve your style marks<br>
